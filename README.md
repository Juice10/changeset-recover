# changeset-recover

recover utility to generate changeset (https://github.com/changesets/changesets) entries when they'd previously been forgetten. Gives library maintainers a chance to double check merged work without fear of missing attribution (or worse, things consumers need to know about!) in the CHANGELOG.

## Usage:

```bash
npx changeset-recover@beta
```
and walk through the interactive UI, editing the changesets it outputs before committing
